\title{Class Constructor for \code{"RDData"}}
\usage{
RDData(d, cutoff)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{a data frame or a list with first column corresponding to the
outcome variable, second column corresponding to the running variable,
optionally a column called \code{"sigma2"} that corresponds to the
conditional variance of the outcome (or an estimate of the conditional
variance), and optionally a column called \code{"weights"} if observations
are aggregated by cell.}

\item{cutoff}{specifies the cutoff for the running variable}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"RDData"}, which is a list containing the
    following components:

    \describe{

    \item{Ym}{Outcome vector for observations below cutoff}

    \item{Yp}{Outcome vector for observations above cutoff}

    \item{Xm}{Running variable for observations below cutoff}

    \item{Xp}{Running variable for observations above cutoff}

    \item{wm}{weights for observations below cutoff}

    \item{wp}{weights for observations above cutoff}

    \item{sigma2m}{Conditional variance of the outcome for observations below
    cutoff}

    \item{sigma2p}{Conditional variance of the outcome for observations above
    cutoff}

    \item{orig.cutoff}{Original cutoff}

    \item{var.names}{Names of the outcome and the running variable in
    supplied data frame}

    }
}
\description{
Convert data to a standardized format for use with low-level functions. If
the cutoff for treatment is non-zero, shift the running variable so that the
cutoff is at zero.

\examples{
## Transform Lee data
d <- RDData(lee08, cutoff=0)
